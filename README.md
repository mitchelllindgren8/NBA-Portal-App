NBA Portal App is backed by a MySQL database login system. This system uses a secure method of accessing
the NBA teams. The application was built in two phases: 1) Phase one was building the project as a 
back-end console application. 2) Phase two was creating an interface and connecting that system to the 
already exsisting console application. I decided to create this project to showcase my abilities and to
learn new java programming techniques.
